'''
Tic Tac Toe blocker

In this Python challenge, write a function thatâ€™ll accept two numbers. These
numbers will represent a position on a tic-tac-toe board. They can be 0 through
8, where 0 is the top-left spot, and 8 is the bottom-right spot.

These parameters are two marks on the tic-tac-toe board. The function should
return the number of the spot that can block these two spots from winning the
game.
